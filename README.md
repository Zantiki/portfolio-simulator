Dependency graph for checking diversification and simulating historical results.

## Graph:
Graoh where each node represents a stock/index/other finacial instrument, where
the edges are weighted after corrolation between the two nodes (between close price 
of the two instruments).

## Simulation:
Calculate cumulative historical return and plot said return.

Check for historical robustness:

* Global Financial Crises

* National Financial Crises

* Sector Bubbles

* Price corrections

* Bankruptcies
